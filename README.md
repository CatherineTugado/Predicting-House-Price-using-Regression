# Predicting House Price using Regression
<p align="justify"> As a key sector of the economy, the real estate market plays a significant role for stakeholders navigating and capitalizing on technological, environmental, and regulatory trends. One aspect of this role pertains to residential properties, which can be analyzed using house price datasets to incorporate essential attributes such as property condition, furnishings, bathroom count, area, total cost, price per square foot, and property location. From these datasets, accurate predictions can be evaluated to provide insights for assisting investors, sellers, buyers, and real estate professionals in effective planning. Additionally, predicting house prices serves a pivotal role in optimizing investment strategies and decision-making processes.

For predicting house prices, regression will be utilized in this project, leveraging historical data to build a mathematical model based on house features or characteristics. This method entails data processing, target plotting, data splitting, model training, evaluation, generating a model performance report, and deployment, all while considering the house features and characteristics.


### Analysis:

The heatmap below displays the top 10 features correlated with SalePrice. It reveals a strong correlation between SalePrice and OverallQual, reaching up to 79%. The correlation of SalePrice with respect to all parameters ranges from 52% to 79%. However, there is a notably weak correlation observed between TotRMSAbvGrd and YearBuilt, as well as YearRemodAdd, ranging from 9.6% to 19%.
